# <horiseon-refractor website rehaul>

## Description

My clients asked me to clean up their code, as the base code had multiple opprotunities to be optmizied. 

During this process I reworked the HTML page, removed overused divisons, added correct syntax for image elements, re-worked the classes for easier reading, and re-formatted the page to meet semantic HTML standards. 

While in CSS I reworked the classes used, combined them where possible, and reworked the order so it would be easier to read. All while keeping the functionality of the website intact.
