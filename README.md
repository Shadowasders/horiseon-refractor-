# <horiseon-refractor website rehaul>

## Description

My clients asked me to clean up their code, as the base code had multiple opprotunities to be optmizied. 

During this process I reworked the HTML page, removed overused divisons, added correct syntax for image elements, re-worked the classes for easier reading, and re-formatted the page to meet semantic HTML standards. 

While in CSS I reworked the classes used, combined them where possible, and reworked the order so it would be easier to read. All while keeping the functionality of the website intact.

This was an exciting opprotunity to polish my skills in HTML. Knowing what to look for in finished code will be extremely helpful when writing my own code in the future. I also learned a few new tricks in CSS with combo-selectors, and can't wait to use them in my personal projects in the future.
